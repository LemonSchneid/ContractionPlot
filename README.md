# ContractionPlot
Contraction timer for my wife.

ContractionPlot is a contraction timer designed to help track the length and frequency of contractions during labor. 
This app was created as an alternative to other contraction timing apps that display ads at inconvenient times.

To use ContractionPlot, simply press the "Start Labor" and "Start Frequency" buttons when labor begins, and leave them alone 
for the duration of the labor. Use the "Start New Contractions" and "End of Contraction" buttons to time each contraction. 
The app will automatically calculate the frequency between contractions.

To view a graph of the length and frequency of contractions, press the "Show Graph" button. 
Note that the app can only generate a graph when a contraction is being timed, as this ensures an even amount of data for the x and y axis. 
Wait until the next contraction begins before pressing "Show Graph."

Finally, ContractionPlot includes a custom red marker on the graph to indicate when it's time to leave for the hospital. 
Please check for any errors or issues and provide feedback for future improvements.
